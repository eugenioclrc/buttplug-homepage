With a retro console for a body and quirky cat buttons that meowed with every press, Patcher was the star of the arcade. Alas, during a heated game of 'Whisker Wars,' a stray elbow sent Patcher tumbling down, resulting in a cracked screen. Now sporting a spiderweb of pixels where a clear image once was, Patcher has embraced this new 'broken screen' aesthetic, claiming it adds character. While no longer the center of attention at the arcade, Patcher has found a new purpose, bringing together a community of nostalgic gamers and retro enthusiasts in the WebtrES club. With arms perennially poised at the ready, Patcher is always eager to lend a hand, or rather, a joystick, to anyone in need of a friend or a fix of old-school gaming.",
